/*
 * Known problems with 2.0[.x] kernels:
 *
 *   - The loopback device gives every packet twice; on 2.2[.x] kernels,
 *     if we use PF_PACKET, we can filter out the transmitted version
 *     of the packet by using data in the "sockaddr_ll" returned by
 *     "recvfrom()", but, on 2.0[.x] kernels, we have to use
 *     PF_INET/SOCK_PACKET, which means "recvfrom()" supplies a
 *     "sockaddr_pkt" which doesn't give us enough information to let
 *     us do that.
 *
 *   - We have to set the interface's IFF_PROMISC flag ourselves, if
 *     we're to run in promiscuous mode, which means we have to turn
 *     it off ourselves when we're done; the kernel doesn't keep track
 *     of how many sockets are listening promiscuously, which means
 *     it won't get turned off automatically when no sockets are
 *     listening promiscuously.  We catch "pcap_close()" and, for
 *     interfaces we put into promiscuous mode, take them out of
 *     promiscuous mode - which isn't necessarily the right thing to
 *     do, if another socket also requested promiscuous mode between
 *     the time when we opened the socket and the time when we close
 *     the socket.
 *
 *   - MSG_TRUNC isn't supported, so you can't specify that "recvfrom()"
 *     return the amount of data that you could have read, rather than
 *     the amount that was returned, so we can't just allocate a buffer
 *     whose size is the snapshot length and pass the snapshot length
 *     as the byte count, and also pass MSG_TRUNC, so that the return
 *     value tells us how long the packet was on the wire.
 *
 *     This means that, if we want to get the actual size of the packet,
 *     so we can return it in the "len" field of the packet header,
 *     we have to read the entire packet, not just the part that fits
 *     within the snapshot length, and thus waste CPU time copying data
 *     from the kernel that our caller won't see.
 *
 *     We have to get the actual size, and supply it in "len", because
 *     otherwise, the IP dissector in tcpdump, for example, will complain
 *     about "truncated-ip", as the packet will appear to have been
 *     shorter, on the wire, than the IP header said it should have been.

	 * The packet comes from a random interface and the packet_rcv

	 * cuts the packet at the snaplen:
	 *
	 * # tcpdump -d
	 * (000) ret      #68
	 *
	 * So the packet filter cuts down the packet. The recvfrom call
	 * says "hey, it's only 68 bytes, it fits into the buffer" with
	 * the result that we don't get the real packet length. This
	 * is valid at least until kernel 2.2.17pre6.
	 *
	 * We currently handle this by making a copy of the filter
	 * program, fixing all "ret" instructions with non-zero
	 * operands to have an operand of MAXIMUM_SNAPLEN so that the
	 * filter doesn't truncate the packet, and supplying that modified
